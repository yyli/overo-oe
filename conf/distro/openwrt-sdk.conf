#@TYPE: Distribution
#@NAME: OpenWRT-SDK
#@DESCRIPTION: Building packages for OpenWRT using its official SDK.
#
#@COMMENT: This allows to build packages only, not the whole images.
#@COMMENT: You should install and have in path an SDK from the www.openwrt.org.
#@COMMENT: SDK installers are both host and target specific (so look in download
#@COMMENT: dir for your target). If there is no SDK for your host arch,
#@COMMENT: you can also look at downloads of x-wrt.org, a sister project.
#@COMMENT: To build a package, use command like:
#@COMMENT: DISTRO=openwrt-sdk TARGET_ARCH=<arch> bitbake <package>
